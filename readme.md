## Next-Level Discord Self-Bot

An incredibly advanced and open-source self-bot developed using Discord.js, designed to elevate your Discord experience with a host of unique features. This self-bot includes functionalities that are rarely seen in similar projects, such as:

- **Built-in Paginator:** Effortlessly navigate through extensive content and lists within Discord.

- **Social Media Reposter:** Seamlessly repost content from popular social media platforms directly to Discord.

### Setup Guide

To get started with your self-bot, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Download the Self-Bot Files:**
   - Obtain the `self` folder from the repository. This folder contains all the necessary files for running the self-bot.

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   - Locate the `.txt` file named `npm` within the `self` folder.
   - Open the `npm.txt` file to view the list of required npm packages. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
   - In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `self` folder, and run the following command to install the packages:
     ```bash
     npm install <package-name>
     ```
     Replace `<package-name>` with each package listed in the `npm.txt` file. Alternatively, you can install all packages at once by running:
     ```bash
     npm install $(cat npm.txt | xargs)
     ```

3. **Run the Self-Bot:**
   - Once all packages are installed, open your terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `self.js` file is located.
   - Run the following command to start the self-bot:
     ```bash
     node self.js
     ```
   - The self-bot should now be active and ready to use.
